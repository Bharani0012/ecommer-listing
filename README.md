# Ecommer-Listing

## Approach

- Component-Based Structure: Utilizes reusable React components for a clean codebase.
- Routing: Implements `react-router-dom` for smooth navigation between pages.
- Responsive Design: Uses CSS Flexbox and media queries to adapt layouts for different screen sizes.
- Filter Section: Designed a user-friendly filter section that works well on both mobile and desktop devices.

## Challenges

Designing the filter section was a key challenge. I focused on:
- Ensuring usability across devices
- Creating a responsive layout
- Implementing dynamic filtering that updates the product list smoothly
